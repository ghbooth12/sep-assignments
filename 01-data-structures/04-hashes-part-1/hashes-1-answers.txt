1. Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
Hints:

* Doubling the size of the area increased the number of open slots in the array for potential values which may lead to more fragmentation.
* Doubling the size of an array (allocating memory) is a slow operation.

  There is a possibility that particular numbers would still have the same modulo value even after doubling the size of the hash array.
  For example, the size of the hash array was initially 6. After resizing, it becomes 12. 12 is multiple of 6. 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, also 12 is divisible by 2 and 3.
